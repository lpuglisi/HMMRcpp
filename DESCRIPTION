Description: This package focuses on implementing a generic Hidden Markov Model algorithm for a continuous-time Markov Chain hidden Markov models. It implements the Viterbi and Forward Backward algorithms in O(nm) time complexity. Each of the functions in this package require three inputs: ts, theta, and obs. ts is a timestamp vector of length m, theta is a double used to calculate the transition probability, and obs is an n x m likelihood matrix of P(observation | state).
